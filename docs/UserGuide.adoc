== Introduction

StudyBuddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manege their module related tasks*.
More importantly, StudyBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Instead of forcing users to remember long wordy and easy-typo commands,
StudyBuddy provides an interactive way of communication, which not only improves
the typo-tolerance of the application, but also makes the application more easy to master.

If you can type fast, StudyBuddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.
