== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`BrandingLabel`, `TaskListPanel`,
 `DueSoonTaskListPanel`, `TaskSummaryPanel`, `CalenderPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `CommandBox`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `TaskListPanel` and `DueSoonTaskListPanel` can switch with `TaskSummaryPanel` or `CalenderPanel` accordingly
as user click `Statistics->Task Summary` or `Calender->Show Calender`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

Study Buddy provides an interactive way for command execution. `AddTaskInteractivePrompt`, `DeleteTaskInteractivePrompt`,
`SortTaskInteractivePrompt` etc are used to handle each types of command executions. Besides, they all `extends` the `InteractivePrompt` abstract class.

The `UI` component,

* Provides interactive command process.
* Allows users to exit from a command execution at any interaction step using `quit`.
* Validate user input in each interaction.
* When invalid input received, proper message will respond in `ResultDisplay` node.
The execution of the command will not be terminated, user can continue with the process with valid input.
* Result in final executable command and executes it using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[NOTE]
The command execution will only terminate in two scenarios: +
1.  When the command is successfully executed. +
2.  When the user enter `quit` and kbd:[enter] to exit the execution.



[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. The `InteractiveCommandPrompt` in `Ui` uses the parsers to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding or editing a task).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying a help message to the user.

//Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

//.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
//image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

//NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width = "500", length = "500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Study Buddy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Study Buddy data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::dueSoon[]
=== Due Soon Tasks Feature

==== Implementation

The Due Soon Tasks feature allows users to view the tasks that have deadlines within the next week.

This feature is implemented using a panel on the main window with a list of tasks due soon that is updated with every "add", "delete" or "refresh".

1. Add --

   Command: add

When a task that is added to the main list, is due within the next week, it is automatically added to the list of due soon tasks.

2. Delete --

   Command: delete

When a task that is deleted from the main list occurs in the due soon list as well, it is automatically deleted.

3. Refresh --

   Command: refresh

Refreshes the list of due soon tasks. This command is useful for a situation where due soon list is not up to date due to a drastic change in time.

==== Example Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the due soon list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The list of tasks due soon will be initialized and displayed with the initial study buddy state. Initialization is done by filtering tasks that are due soon from the general list of tasks.

Activity diagram:

image::AddDueSoonActivityDiagram.png[width = "200", length = "300"]

Step 2. The user executes `add` command to add a task.
The `add` command execution checks if this task belongs in the due soon tasks list (i.e it is due in 7 days). If it does, the task is added to both lists, else it is only added to the main list.

Step 3. The user executes `delete` command to delete a task.
The `delete` command execution also checks if this task exists in the due soon task list. If it does, task is deleted from both lists, else it is only deleted from the main list.

Step 4. The user executes `due soon` command to refresh the due soon task list.
The `due soon` command execution will traverse the main list and check if there are any inconsistencies. For example, if there has been a change in time and a task is missing from the due soon task list, it will be added.

[NOTE]
If there are no such inconsistencies, the due soon command will not make any changes.

Activity diagram:

image::DueSoonActivityDiagram.png[width = "400", length = "600"]

Sequence diagram:

image::DueSoonSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600", length = "500"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `due soon` command works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not clear and reload the due soon task list.
** Pros: Fewer operations need to be performed.
** Cons: May have be more prone to errors because list is not completely "refreshed". Some parts of it are the same.
* **Alternative 2:** Clear and reload the due soon task list.
** Pros: Less prone to errors since the entire list is "refreshed".
** Cons: More operation intensive.
// end::dueSoon[]

// tag::taskSummary[]
=== Task Summary Feature

==== Implementation

The task summary feature allows user to enjoy visualized and real-time statistics of their tasks' information.

This feature is implemented using different charts as `pie chart`, `area chart`, `bar chart` and `line chart`.
All charts are organized in a `TabPanel` which will replace the `ListPanel` and `Due Soon List Panel` in the main window when
`Task Summary` in the `Menu` is clicked.

The data of each chart will automatically rebind when user manage their tasks using the commands as below:

* `add`
* `done`
* `delete`
* `refresh`

[NOTE]
Only when there is task status change after `refresh`, the charts will refresh accordingly.

==== Example Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the task summary mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with some alive and archived task records in the `storage`.
Statistics will perform on the records retrieved, and the result will be visualized as different charts organized in a `tab panel`.
After the user clicks `Statistics -> Task Summary`, the `tab panel` will display.
The user successfully executes `add`, `delete` or `done` command when any chart is on the screen.
The diagram will automatically refresh and reflect the updated record.

Step 2. The user successfully executes `add`, `delete` or `done` command when any chart is on the screen.
The diagram will automatically refresh and reflect the updated record.


Step 3. The user executes `refresh` command, and there is a task status update after the execution.
For example, when the user is playing with the application, and meanwhile, a task expires.
The status won't update until user call `refresh` command. In this case, the chart will also automatically refresh and reflect the updated record.

Step 4. The user executes `refresh`, and there is no task status update after the execution. The charts will remain the same.


Activity diagram for step 4:

image::TaskSummaryWithRefreshCommandActivityDiagram.png[width = "400", length = "600"]


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to display charts

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `tab panel` to organize different charts.
** Pros: Easy to organize and the UI is clean.
** Cons: Less interaction, and clicking is required. While allowing user to use command to switch among different tabs is under construction.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a simple `panel` to hold the chart, and allow user to use command to toggle the type of charts.
** Pros: More flexible and more interaction possibilities.
** Cons: The cost overweight the benefit.

==== Future possibility
===== Question: should we write this in DG?
// end::taskSummary[]



//tag:calendar[]
=== Calendar feature

==== Implementation
The calendar feature, as the name suggests, displays a calendar fo users.

The feature is implemented by overriding the task list display panel on the main window with calendar box. The calendar currently supports following features:

. Displays the name of all tasks on that day in the calendar grid.
. Access calendars in previous or next month using the buttons on top.
. Displays more information about tasks for the day on the due soon panel after clicking on a grid. (Not done)
. Fast forward to a specific year/month using CLI. (Not done)

==== Example usage scenario
Clicking on the show calendar menu item under the calendar menu will enable this feature. Upon requesting for the calendar to be shown:

. The calendar box object will be constructed
. The calendar loops through every day of the month while searching for tasks due on that day
. The task name is added to the calendar grid

Activity diagram:

image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[width = "400", length = "600"]

==== Design considerations
* It is more efficient to cache the calendar rather than to generate a new one, however, we do not expect the user to have too many tasks (n>1000000) and therefore it should not slow down the application.

=== Archive feature
Archive stores selected task away into a separate task list, this command is used when the user has completed a task but still wants to keep track of it.

==== Implementation
Archive uses both the old delete and a new archive command. Upon executing the archive command, it will call the model to delete the task and archive it elsewhere.

Sequence diagram:

image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600", length = "500"]

=== Achievement feature
The achievement feature keeps track of usage statistics and displays the user's achievements
and feedback on the user's weekly performance.

==== Implementation
The achievement feature keeps track of usage statistics that are important to the user.
Each usage statistic is recorded when the respective user command has completed. The user command is
said to be completed when the respective `InteractivePrompt` has completed successfully.

For example, the following are the usage statistics logged for the `CompleteTaskInteractivePrompt`.

.  Number of tasks completed
.  Number of tasks completed on time
.  Number of tasks deadlines missed
.  Average amount of time exceeded
.  Average amount of buffer time
.  Time spent on each type of task

Similarly, usage statistics are recorded for other user commands as well.

==== Example Use Scenario
Clicking on the achievement menu item will enable this feature.

==== Design Considerations
Pending.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Modules
The `modules` feature enables users to be able to group and view their tasks according to various modules or subjects.
Each module is assigned with a unique module code & a name.
By default, all task created with the `add` command will be be assigned to module code `OO0000O`.

==== Implementation
Modules are created with `create mods` Command and the program will request for a module name and module code. There are no restrictions on module name as long as it is not an empty entry.

Module codes however, require at least an alphabetical prefix, a number, and a postfix(optional).

```
Correct moduleCodes:
A0A
CS11X
AA1234

Incorrect moduleCodes:
123456
CAT
555T
```

==== Sequence diagram for creating modules
This is a sequence of how a module is created using the `create mods` feature. Take note that all interactions go through the `CommandBox` first in the UI, but it will be omitted from this diagram for simplicity.

image::UMLmodule.jpeg[width = "1000", length = "800"]



=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
